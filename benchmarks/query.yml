      # Execution Strategy: the type of the benchmark to run. Options are:
      # REQUESTS_PER_SECOND: Fixed duration, fixed rps. Example parameters:
      #   duration: 10s
      #   rps: 500
      # FIXED_REQUEST_NUMBER: Complete requests as fast as possible, no duration. Example parameters:
      #   requests: 10000
      # MAX_REQUESTS_IN_DURATION: Make as many requests as possible in duration. Example parameters:
      #   duration: 10s
      # MULTI_STAGE: (K6 only currently) Several stages of REQUESTS_PER_SECOND benchmark. Example parameters:
      #   initial_rps: 0
      #   stages:
      #     - duration: 5s

      # CUSTOM: Pass completely custom options to each tool (see full API spec for all supported options, very large)
